# Git-Intro #
Git is a very detailed and complex collaborative tool. The sheer amount of meticulousness and tedious structure is daunting but also reassuring. The way a tool like this is used and what it is used for makes since for it to be very precise in how it is used. If a large company such as Amazon, Google, or Apple are going to have hundreds or thousands of developers working on the same or multiple projects and updates then the way they are able to work together has to be incredibly detailed and secure. I learned a fair amount of information from this reading. I feel I've learned the foundation of Git. It comes down to saving changes, tracking those changes and altering the commits you've made. There is much much more to it but you always want to make sure you commit your changes. Almost all commited information in Git can be recovered, however any uncommitted information can be lost forever.

### Branching ###

Branching is still a little confusing for me but it basically sounds like a collaborator can create a branch, work on it and commit within that branch and also switch to other branches and on top of that they can also merge the changes. I still have a lot to learn about branching.

### Aliases ###

The Aliases are a pretty cool feature that allows you to create custom aliases for git commands. This can save a lot of time especially when you haven't memorized the commands yet. I will definitely be using this once i memorize the commands.
